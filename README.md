Theis repository is quite large but download, clone with git or checkout with subversion

## Whats included
SparseGridCollocationCpp - pure C++ version with no dependency on CUDA or an NVidia Graphics card
SparseGridCollocation - The main CUDA-enabled project
Dissertation - Pdf, tex and supporting files for the dissertation document.

## Dependencies
Eigen - should be already within the \include directory
QuantLib - download and install the version listed in the dissertation document
Intel MKL - as above
CUDA SDK 8 - install if running the CUDA enabled version.

Whilst I've tested both solutions on several platforms, if anything appears to be missing please don't hesitate to contact me.
